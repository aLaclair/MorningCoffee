# MorningCoffee
Thank you for viewing my app. MorningCoffee is a full-stack application that is designed to help you plan your day by adding blocks of information with a specified endtime <a href='http://morningcoffee.thelaclair.com' target='_blank'>MorningCoffee - Live</a>

## How to Navigate

Upon arriving to the page, you will be asked to Login. Don't worry, if you haven't created an account yet, fill out the information and hit create user
**This site is not secure so please do not use a meaningful password**
After logging in or creating a user, you will see a small plus button that allows you to add schedule blocks to your day. Create as many as you'd like for the day! If you would like to delete a schedule block, there is a trash can icon in the upper right hand corner of the block that will delete it from your day as well as our database.

## How to use Locally

If you choose to clone this repo to make your own changes, run npm install once navigated to the file in your local IDE, and npm run start to start your live server
